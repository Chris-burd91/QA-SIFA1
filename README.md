### Introduction:

This is a web app designed with QA for the purpose of managing stock items and orders.
The Original purpose of this project was to be a full fledged website to sell products on the front-end and move stock orders around on the "back-end", I use quotes as the 2 portions of the website are basically 2 different functions in themselves and would be 2 different systems entirely. 

### The WebApp Discription
Now this has become a simple inventory system for a warehouse as to place orders from one user, to be viewed by many other users which can delete or edit the order when it needs to be updated with order status or changes to details, and when the order is complete it is to be deleted as to not waste space on the orders board. There is also the stock board which allows users to add stock to the list and update it when price changes occure or when items are no longer in stock to be removed by the user.

### The Technologies used:
Jira-Kanban Board
Git & GitHub - Source Control System and Management System
MySQL - Database Instance
EDRs made  in Draw.io
Programmin Language - Python/HTML
Micro-Framework - Flask

### Jira
We used Jira as our planning board, when to get certain objectives done and how they would be done. This is to structure our method of working in an agile way in regards to the waterfall method as this is highly fexible way of working and allows both the client and the buisness to continuously add input to the project as to have a clearer view of what the product will be like, this also is more benificial as constant contact in regards to the project will create a better product.

### Git & GitHub
We used these technologies to allow us to be more careful with our programming and coding in regards to the project as mistakes can happen, git allows us to branch our project into different sections as to not disturb the main branch of code(in case anything happends). This allowed me to work on different sections of my project and be able to revert back to a different branch if I made a mistake that I could not fix later on. This is the benifit of using git. Github is the management system that allowed us to store the code for reference later on and to clone down from when needed.

### MySQL
This is the Database interface I used from my project and was where I would store data, Using CRUD as the basis of this project being able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data whenever we needed or see fit.

### Python
This makes up the bulk of the Webapp itself as it allow us to create the tables for our MySQL Database, the input forms in the app itself and the functions that allowed the webapp to function itself using logic to get information out onto a html page.

### Flask
The micro-framwork that allowed us to use python to develop the webapp and using jinja 2 logic to allow information from databases to be used by python code to output data onto a html page.

### Test Coverage:
In this WebApp I got a test coverage of 75% in my Unit tests and developed 4 different intergration tests that allowed the test user to add data.
I did get a number of failed test due to the fact of an error I was unable to solve, it would be the type error where arguments were mixing and did not know where the issue laid.
